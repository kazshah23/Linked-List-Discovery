# Mosaic-Maker
A PhotoMosaic is a picture created by taking some source picture, dividing it up into rectangular sections, and replacing each section with a small thumbnail image whose color closely approximates the color of the section it replaces. Viewing the PhotoMosaic at low magnification, the individual pixels appear as the source image, while a closer examination reveals that the image is made up of many smaller tile images.

## Getting Started
## Software 
My implementation was fully in C++ and utilized the cmake platform for build automation and testing. The bulk of my algorithms are in my src folder.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone 
   ```
2. Make the `build` directory :
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    ```
3. Change directory into the `build` folder:
    ```sh
    cd build
    ```
4. In the `build` directory, "run cmake .."
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```
5. In the `build` directory, run make test && ./test to make sure all tests are passing
   ```sh
    make test && ./test
   ```
6. To see the output and breakdown of the code run make main && ./main  
    ```sh
   make main && ./main
    ```
